# Data-606-Capstone

Cybercrime is a growing problem and according to the latest Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, North America alone accounts for 55% of total data breaches in the world which only 920 incidents were publicly disclosed in 2020 (2020 Data Breach Investigations Report). Recent events such as the SolarWinds (APT𑁋Trojan Horse), the Colonial Pipeline hack (Ransomware), and JBS Foods attacks have affected millions causing tremendous loss and revealed serious gaps in cyber defenses in both public and private organizations. 
For instance, companies such as Accenture are using Natural Language processing to unlock the value of Cyber data in user cases such as Insider Threat detection. According to the Ponemon Institute’s report, " the overall cost of insider threats is rising, with a 31% increase from $8.76 million in 2018 (Ponemon) to $11.45 million in 2020. In addition, the number of incidents has increased by a staggering 47% in just two years, from 3,200 in 2018 (Ponemon) to 4,716 in 2020.”(Ponemon Institute). 
 The purpose of this project is to close the gaps in properly labeling  and classifying observations against type of breach and industry to make better predictions and ideally prevent or better prepare for  future attacks, ultimately reducing potential damage. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable hence Cyber Security is highly composed of text. 
 
 Data Set
For my capstone project, I’m using the data set Chronology of Data Breaches by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization that empowers individuals and advocates for positive change within the ever-changing privacy landscape. Most of the data was sourced from State Attorneys General and  the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which is regularly updated. The units of analysis are the following: City, state, company, type of breach, type of industry, Description of incident, the date made public, the source, the year of breach, the number of total records, the URL, the latitude, and longitude, and etc. The Data Set is composed of 13 columns, 9015 rows, 4375 KB (4.375 MB), and contains both numerical and text data. 
Data Elements:
Type of Breach
CARD𑁋Fraud Involving Debit and Credit Cards Not Via Hacking (skimming devices at point-of-service terminals, etc.)
